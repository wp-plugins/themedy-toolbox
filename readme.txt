The Themedy Toolbox extends functionality of our Themedy Themes. It provides a easy to use shortcodes plugin to easily add buttons and more.

== Description ==

Themedy Toolbox is a very powerful, yet easy to use shortcodes plugin. Shortcodes can be generated via the new Themedy button in your editor in the Visual tab of the WordPress editor.

You can add buttons, columns, social icons and links, accordions, toggles, tabs, alert boxes, pull quotes, responsive Youtube and Vimeo videos, and maps to your site by simply filling out a few options and clicking the Insert Shortcode button.

Please note that this plugin will work outside our <a href="http://themedy.com">Themedy themes</a>, but we will not provide support for any issues with other themes.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `themedy-toolbox` folder to your to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or alternatively upload the themedy-toolbox.zip via the plugin page of WordPress by clicking 'Add New' and select the zip from your local computer.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the page/post editor and you should see a new button on your toolbar (the icon is a grey button with our /// logo mark)
4. On the popup that appears, choose which shortcode you would like to add from the left and then fill out the options on the right.
5. Click the Insert Shortcode button to add the shortcode to the editor.
6. To enable the Custom CSS module visit Tools -> Themedy Toolbox to enable it.
