Contact Form 7 workaround

/custom-css/class.jetpack.php - rename class
/custom-css/custom-css.php - rename old class to new class
/custom-css.php - remove plugin header to avoid plugin header error messages

This is because Contact Form 7 thinks JetPack is loaded and looks for the contact form module, which we don't load the function to do this, regular JetPack does.
